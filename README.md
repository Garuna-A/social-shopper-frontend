## üéØ Motive behind the project

In an era where digital convenience has often led to social isolation, we built SocialShopper to bring people back together through collaborative shopping. 

Our submission for Walmart Sparkathon, SocialShopper enables groups to create shared shopping rooms, suggest items, vote, and finalize purchases collectively. By blending practicality with a social layer, we aim to make shopping more interactive, democratic, and fun.
